This project was bootstrapped with Create React App. I took data from https://www.coingecko.com/pl/api#explore-api .

You have to install node and npm to start this project.

Youâ€™ll need to have Node >= 10 on your local development machine.

npm is distributed with Node.js- which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get npm installed on your computer. https://nodejs.org/en/

In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
